    Parameters
    ----------
    expr:

    walk_canonical:
        When True (default), attempt to reduce ``expr`` to a
        lower-cost equivalent via :func:`eml_rewrite.path`. When a
        ``canonical_target`` is supplied, walk specifically to that

    canonical_target:
        Optional explicit target expression to walk toward. Useful
        when the caller already knows the canonical form they want.
        When omitted, the routine asks :func:`eml_rewrite.path` to
        walk to ``eml_rewrite.best(expr)`` — i.e., whatever the

    Notes
    -----
    ``verified_in_lean`` is hard-coded to ``False`` here. The flag
    flips to ``True`` only via post-construction patching after the
    user verifies ``EML_Universality.lean`` in the VS Code lean4
    extension. See ``feedback_lean_writing_protocol_2026_04_25.md``.
